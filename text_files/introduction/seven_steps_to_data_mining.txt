seven steps to data mining
--------------------------

data acquisition = data extraction + data loading
data acquisition - data extraction from one source or many 
                   sources, bringing it in the form of a csv file
                   and then loading data in to a dataframe
                   csv, tsv and json
                   data acquisition = data extraction + data loading

data inspection  - look at data from different view points

data cleaning    - data deletion, data formatting, data inserted
                   data replacement, data filling - data imputation

data preprocessing - rescaling, standarization, normalization  
                     and binarization, dimenstionality reduction, data encoding

data analysis - summary statistics, data skewness, data kurtosis 
                data correlation, causation and regression, density estimation, 
                principal component analysis, what if analysis

modelling -     regression, classification, clustering, outlier 
                detection and time series analysis

results and
visualization - data visualization from different view points,
                listing results and taking a decision
