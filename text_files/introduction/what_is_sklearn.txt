what is sklearn ?

Scikit-learn (Sklearn) is the most useful and robust library for machine learning in Python. It provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction via a consistence interface in Python.

What are the features of sklearn ?

Simple and efficient tools for predictive data analysis
Accessible to everybody, and reusable in various contexts
Built on NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib
Open source, commercially usable - BSD license


Scikit-learn is a library in Python that provides many unsupervised and supervised learning algorithms. Itâ€™s built upon some of the technology you might already be familiar with, like NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib!

The functionality that scikit-learn provides include:

Regression, including Linear and Logistic Regression
Classification, including K-Nearest Neighbors
Clustering, including K-Means and K-Means++
Model selection
Preprocessing, including Min-Max Normalization
